# Legally Distinct Duck Flapping Up Down Pipe Dodging Simulator Remastered GOTY Edition 2.2

Silly game I made to practice Lua and LÃ–VE.

Pressing the button on the top left of the menu using touch or LMB mutes peak 21 Savage (if you, for some reason, wanted to do so).
Press the up arrow, LMB or touch the screen anywhere but the mute button to start.
Pipes appear and scroll right to left.
Bullets appear randomly somewhere between the top and bottom of the screen on the right side and vary in speed and size.
The game will get gradually more difficult over time, speeding up the pipes, the bullets and making the bird more uncontrollable.
